# About

## ...the author

Fond of IT for many years, I obtained a CFC in business IT in 2025, after a
short stop in college. Although I do enjoy software and web development, my
favorite areas remain the deployment, maintenance and administration of
**infrastructure** and **systems**.

This website has several purposes, including:

- Presenting the result of **personal projects**.
- Providing **concrete explanations** to common problems or to the ones I have
  encountered.
- **Sharing** discoveries and discussing topics I find interesting.

## ...the website

This website has been built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a custom fork of the Hugo Theme Terminal Theme called [Momiko Terminal](https://github.com/wolfiiy/hugo-theme-momiko-terminal).

The theme is still a WIP and might change quite a bit in the near future. Compared to the original, this fork adds the following features:

- URLs are highlighted when hovered with the mouse.
- Tables of content can be toggled with a click (hidden by default).
- A faint glow has been added to some elements when they are hovered with the mouse.
- An alternative compact view for lists, with an independant limit of posts per page (an example can be seen [here](/posts)).
- A faint glow and scanlines have been applied to the entirety of the website to make it feel even more CRT-ish.
- First headings have been turned into `> Command prompts_`.
