# Hi there

My name is Radek and I'm the author of this theme. I made it to help you present your ideas easier.

We all know how hard is to start something on the web, especially these days. You need to prepare a bunch of stuff, configure them and when that’s done — create the content.

This theme is pretty basic and covers all of the essentials. All you have to do is start typing!

The theme includes:

- fully customizable color schemes generated by [**terminal.css**](https://panr.github.io/terminal-css/).
- great reading experience thanks to [**Fira Code**](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).
- nice code highlighting thanks to [**PrismJS**](https://prismjs.com) that matches the theme's color scheme.

So, there you have it... enjoy!
